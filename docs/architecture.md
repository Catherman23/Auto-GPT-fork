## Core Components

### Agent System
The agent system is the core of Auto-GPT, orchestrating the interaction between different components:
- Task planning and execution
- Command processing
- Memory management
- Plugin coordination

### Command System
Commands are discrete actions that the agent can perform:
- File operations
- Web interactions
- Code analysis
- Git operations
- Image generation

### Configuration
The configuration system handles:
- Environment variables
- API keys
- Plugin settings
- Memory backend configuration

### Memory System
Auto-GPT uses a sophisticated memory system with:
- Short-term memory for immediate context
- Long-term memory for persistent information
- Multiple backend options (Pinecone, Milvus, Redis, Weaviate)

### Plugin System
The plugin architecture allows extending Auto-GPT's capabilities:
- ZIP-based plugin loading
- OpenAI plugin integration
- Plugin lifecycle hooks
- Security controls (allowlist/denylist)

### Prompt Management
The prompt system manages:
- Template generation
- Context assembly
- Response processing

## Data Flow

1. User provides a goal or task
2. Agent processes the input through prompt templates
3. Planning system determines required actions
4. Commands are executed with appropriate plugins
5. Results are stored in memory
6. Process repeats until goal is achieved

## Key Interfaces

### Plugin Interface
Plugins must implement:
- Lifecycle methods (pre/post hooks)
- Command handlers
- Response processors

### Memory Interface
Memory backends must provide:
- Storage/retrieval
- Context management
- Query capabilities

## Security Considerations

- Plugin verification
- API key management
- Command restrictions
- Memory access controls

## Extension Points

Auto-GPT can be extended through:
1. Custom plugins
2. New commands
3. Memory backends
4. Prompt templates
5. Model implementations
